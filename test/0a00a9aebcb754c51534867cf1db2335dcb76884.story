Manchester United's Spaniards may have struggled to gel on the pitch, but they have been building up a close relationship off it.

Juan Mata, Ander Herrera and David de Gea have become good friends and enjoyed lunch together in Hale Village, Cheshire on Tuesday afternoon.

The Spanish trio were all named in Louis van Gaal's starting line-up for the opening day fixture against Swansea, although they were unable to prevent a disappointing 2-1 defeat bySwansea.

Van Gaal has brought another Spanish speaker to Old Trafford, with Argentina defender Marcos Rojo describing it as a 'dream' to play for the Old Trafford club.

The Sporting Lisbon player has emerged has been a key summer target for Van Gaal and United have paid £16million for the defender and sent Portuguese winger Nani back to his former club on a one-year loan deal.

In an interview with the radio station Continental, quoted in several national newspapers, Rojo said: 'It's a dream to play at Manchester United and I am very proud of having the chance of working with [Louis] van Gaal.

'I spoke with Juan Sebastian Veron about Manchester United when we were at Estudiantes. I have always liked English football, and I should adapt to this new playing style easily.'
