Jack Wilshere and Danny Welbeck looked in good shape as they trained with their team-mates on Monday. Arsenal's first goal of the season came from a penalty kick by David Beckham, who scored the second goal for the Gunners. The goal was an impressive effort from the England international, who also scored the first goal for the club.
