A breakthrough in genetic science could pavethe way for the developments of drugs. The study, led by scientists at Imperial College London over the last decade, used new ways to study the genes in the immune system and other allergies. The researchers found that the genes that control asthma were most active in asthmatics with low levels of methylation. The researchers said:
