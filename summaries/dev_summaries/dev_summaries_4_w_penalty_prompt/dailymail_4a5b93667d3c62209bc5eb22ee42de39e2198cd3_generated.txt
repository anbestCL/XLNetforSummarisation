A local council has been left red-faced after photos surfaced of a botched line marking job on a Brisbane road. The photo posted on social media by a resident of the Moreton Bay Regional Council (MBRC) area shows a white line marking painted over a pile of leaves and bark. The photo was snapped on Mount Nebo Road north of Brisbane.
