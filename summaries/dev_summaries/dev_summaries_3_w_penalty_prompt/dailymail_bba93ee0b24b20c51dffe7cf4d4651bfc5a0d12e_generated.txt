A bizarre tale of torture and amnesia is set to unfold in a Queensland court on Monday. The case involves a man from central Queensland who has been charged with torture, after another man went to hospital suffering fractures and head injuries. Officers arrested a man from suburban Kepnock who was admitted to Bundaberg Hospital (pictured).
