Danny Willett gave a rules official, who had been in his line-of-sight, a verbal blast which was clearly audible to spectators surrounding the 17th green at the Masters on Thursday. Willett's anger was vented after his second shot from beyond the green fell all the way across the putting surface and left the preacher facing a bogey.
