A 1921 application form to join theracist Ku Klux Klan organisation has emerged. The form asks ‘what is your race?’, and then it asks ‘what is your ethnicity?’. The form is a short-form booklet with a photo of the group. It contains a list of questions to be answered. The first question is ‘your race?’.
