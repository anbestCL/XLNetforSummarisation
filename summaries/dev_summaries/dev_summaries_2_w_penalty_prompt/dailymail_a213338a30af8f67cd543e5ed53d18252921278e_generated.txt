A famous tiger temple in Thailand- where Buddhist monks ride the giant cats - has been cleared of mistreating the animals who live there. The tigers are a popular attraction for tourists in Thailand, but the temple has been banned from handling them. The temple has been banned from handling the animals since 2001 after allegations of drugging the tigers.
