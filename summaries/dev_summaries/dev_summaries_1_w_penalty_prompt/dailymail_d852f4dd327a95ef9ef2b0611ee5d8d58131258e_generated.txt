A holidaymaker used his camera torecord the frightening moment a mother elephant and her calf chased a Jeep full of safari tourists in Africa. The footage shows the mother elephant's calf running away from the carload of safari tourists. Anthon van Dijk, from the Netherlands, pulled out his camera as the mother elephant and her calf ran away from the vehicle.
