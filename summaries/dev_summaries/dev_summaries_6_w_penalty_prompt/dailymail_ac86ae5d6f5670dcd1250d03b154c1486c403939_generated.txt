A prankster has registered a x-rated website domain in the name of a married Texas Republican congressman. The contact details are related to the prankster's computer business, Farenthold Consulting Group. The email address and telephone number on the listing links back to the Tea Party member's Elect Blake Farenthold Committee. Prank victim? No joke!
