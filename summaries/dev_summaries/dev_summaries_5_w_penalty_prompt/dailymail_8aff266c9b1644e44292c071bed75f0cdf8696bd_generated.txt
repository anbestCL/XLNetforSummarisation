Itâ€™s been another interesting weekfor us at Matchroom Boxing. New arrival: Nathan Cleverly has joined forces with Matchroom Boxing. I have been working with him since last year and he is a great fighter. He is a very good fighter and he has done so much in the sport. I think he is ready to go back to Liverpool.
