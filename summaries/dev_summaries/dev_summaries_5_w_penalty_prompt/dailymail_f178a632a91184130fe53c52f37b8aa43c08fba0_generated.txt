A hilarious blunder at a company producingWorld Cup merchandise has seen Barack Obama mistaken for defender Chris Smalling on a set of mugs. The head and shoulders photo printed on the mugs show Obama wearing the England football top, with the caption 'Chris Smalling World Cup squad Brazil 2014' beneath it. The real Chris Smalling please stand up?
