By. Stephanie Linning. Agambling fan decided to celebrate his second divorce by sponsoring a horse race - and he backed the winner. The event was run over two miles and six furlongs, with the last couple being celebrated with a day out at the Devon racecourse. Cheers! David Chillery's second divorce was celebrated every year.
