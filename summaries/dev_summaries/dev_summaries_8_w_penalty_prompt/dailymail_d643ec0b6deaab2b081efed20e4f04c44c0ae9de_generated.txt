A video recording the comments a womanhears in her neighborhood is a testament to the pervasiveness of street harassment women face. The video was shot in Manhattan, New York City, where it was released Tuesday. It was edited down to a 2-minute final product. The creators said Wednesday that the video was viewed over 10 hours one day in Manhattan.
