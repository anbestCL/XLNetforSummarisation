In a claim reportedly worth $1.62 billion, Brisbane-born dance choreographer Wade Robson alleges he was repeatedly molested and raped by Michael Jackson. The allegations are based on a series of false statements made by the deceased singer in the late 1990s. According to the alleged statement, Mr Robson was sexually abused from age seven to 14.
