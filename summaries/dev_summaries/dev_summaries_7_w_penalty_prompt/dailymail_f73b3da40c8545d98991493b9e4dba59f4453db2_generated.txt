A luxury £60,000 Maserati car crashed into a packed London pub that is aptly called The Plough. Pictured is the sportscar which crashed in to the venue on Friday night. Shocked drinkers watched as the sportscar smashed into a blue Mercedes before careering into the front window of the popular bar on St John’s Hill.
