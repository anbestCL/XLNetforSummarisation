Chelsea defender Gary Cahill has backed captainJohn Terry to shrug off a hostile reception when they head to Loftus Road on Sunday. The Premier League game at Loftus Road on Sunday will be the first in a series of games against Arsenal and Chelsea since the summer of 2011. It was on the same ground in 2011 that Terry was caught up in a race controversy.
