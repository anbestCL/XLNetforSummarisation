Saved: The eight-monthold female harbor seal, known as Pup 49, was found in a beach in Plymouth Massachusetts last July. Experts believe the injury was caused by an infection spread through her body - causing her to become infected. The decision to amputate her flipper was made after vets found the infection had spread through her bones.
